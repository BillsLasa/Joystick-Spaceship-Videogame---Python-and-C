## Main Files description 📘

* **[spiderbotCodigo.m]**: This file can be run in Matlab software. The code consists of finding the position of the leg joints of a spider robot in three-dimensional space. It is the most basic file and has no graphical interface.  

* **[spiderbotApp.mlapp]**: This file can be executed in Matlab using App Designer. The file contains both the functional code as well as the graphical user interface. This file consists of finding the position of the leg of a robot spider according to the angle of the joints that can be modified by sliders, making a wireframe sketch.

Note: Both files are independent. You can use one or the other depending on whether you want a graphical interface or not.


## Folders description 📁

* **[imagenes]**: This folder contains all the necessary images that are called by the spiderbotApp.mlapp file
